"""Apply the JLCPCB board constraints to every board's .kicad_pro.

Board Setup -> Design Rules -> Constraints is a hard floor DRC applies to
everything, and a rule in the .kicad_dru cannot relax it. So the floor is set to
the loosest the process allows and the rules file carries the per-case numbers;
otherwise the floor silently masks them.

    python3 tools/set_constraints.py [--dry-run]

Skips any project KiCad currently has open, because saving from the GUI would
write the old values straight back.
